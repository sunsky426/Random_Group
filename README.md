## Random Group: the True Random Group Generator

Random Group is a group maker for school and clubs that utilizes truly random generation methods, such as atmosphric noise, instead of pseudo-random algorithms.

Dedicated to my teacher who likes to complain that Random Group generators available on the internet isn't random enough.
